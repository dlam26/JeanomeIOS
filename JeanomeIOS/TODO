1. 11/9/2011    Sign in with facebook button using the sdk i git cloned

2. 11/9/2011   Upload pictures somehow

    Q. What does the upload request look like?  (where the hell is the file?)

    views.py:203   request.POST: {u'category': [u''], u'note': [u'22'], u'brand': [u'222'], u'do_add_item': [u'Submit'], u'value': [u'222']}
    
    
3.    Get logged in users facebook id

https://graph.facebook.com/me?fields=id&access_token=d6fbb26e9641b665b717120bc9fa0fe7


4. On settings page input for URL, if there's a trailing slash, remove it 

5. Do picture upload in a thread/block

6. Show user facebook picture when logged in

7. 11/30/2011   If the user has never logged into Jeanome, the api will return some bad JSON when looking at their closet page,  so it needs to create it somehow.
